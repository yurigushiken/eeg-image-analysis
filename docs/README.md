# Project Website Source

This directory contains the source files for the project's public-facing website, which is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## How it Works

*   The website is built automatically from the files in this `/docs` directory on the `main` branch.
*   Any changes pushed to this directory will be reflected on the live site at [https://yurigushiken.github.io/eeg-image-analysis/](https://yurigushiken.github.io/eeg-image-analysis/).
*   The site consists of simple HTML, CSS, and image files, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
